<h1 class="p-4 text-[48px] font-bold">Lesson 7 : Adjectives</h1>
<p>
	<span class="underline italic font-semibold">Definition:</span>
	An adjective is a word that modifies, or changes, a noun.

    A cat walked past my window. 

    Everyone who reads that sentence probably pictures a different cat.

    A large orange striped cat walked past my window. 

    Now I have modified the picture in your mind so it matches mine.


    Adjectives answer the questions which one, what kind, and how much/many.

	Which one: That car has been in a crash.
	What kind: We have black squirrels in our neighborhood.
	How much: I ate too much sugar for breakfast.
	How many: I saw five swans in our pond.

<p class="mt-4">
	<span class="underline italic font-semibold">Definition:</span>
	The articles are the most common of all adjectives. There are three of them: the, a, and an.

	Definite article: the (You know which one you are talking about.)
	Indefinite articles: a, an (You don't know which one you are talking about.)

	Use a before a word that begins with a consonant sound (not a consonant letter). Use an before a word that begins with a vowel sound (not a vowel letter). An was created because it is difficult to say a before a word that begins with a vowel sound. An is easier to say. Therefore, it is the sound of the beginning of the word that matters, not the letter itself.

    a carrot, a unicorn, a yellow apple (Yes, u is a vowel, but the sound is a consonant y sound)
    an apple, an umbrella, an honor (Yes, h is a consonant, but the sound is a vowel o sound)
