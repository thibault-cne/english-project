<p>
	<span class="underline italic font-semibold">Definition:</span>
	When most people think about verbs, they think about the first type: action verbs, also called dynamic
	verbs. This kind of verb tells you what's happening or what someone is doing. Some action verbs describe
	physical actions, and they are easy to spot because you can observe them with at least one of your
	five senses. These are words such as jump, sing, and eat. On the other hand, some action verbs are
	more abstract, and they're easy to miss sometimes because you can't always observe them with your five
	senses. These are words such as think, learn, and decide. Take a look at the examples below to see
	how action verbs are used in a sentence.

	<span class="underline italic font-semibold">Physical Actions:</span>
	The neighbor's cats meow loudly. You hear the meow and you may see the cat open its mouth to meow.
	Trucks speed down the highway. You can see the truck speeding and probably hear the motor too. Waves
	crash on the shore. You can see and hear the wave and even feel it crash if you're standing close enough.

	Students learn new material every day. You can't actually look into someone's brain and see the learning
	process, but learning is still an action. I think my shoes are under the bed. You can't really see
	the thoughts going through the person's mind, but thinking is still an action. It's what you're doing.
